• (4 pts) Provide 2 details for each of the 2 tests, according to the scenario (1pt/detail)

Test 1:
Use the other temperature sensor to compare the readings. We can compute the 
difference between the sensor readings and set an allowable threshold of 
difference. If the difference is large enough over a certain time period, we can 
infer that the additional sensor may be faulty. To recover from this, you would 
have to replace the other sensor or rely solely on the working one.

Test 2:
Turn on the fan and check log all temperature sensors. For each sensor, measure 
difference in temperature after the fan step and compute cross correlation 
between RPM and temperature (should be negative with a small delay). If only 
the new sensor shows no/odd response while others respond normally, then we can 
infer that it is sensor placement/fault. If all sensors show weak cooling while 
temperature remains high, then it could be an airflow/fan issue or insufficient 
capacity.



• (1 pt) Choose one of the tests and provide 2 reasons why it is preferred

Preferred Test: Test 1 (Cross-Sensor Comparison)
Reason 1: Test 1 doesn't interfere with the regular schedule or operations. 
Test 1 passively monitors and compares sensor data without requiring the TerraBot 
to take any additional actions, meaning that watering, lighting, and humidity 
control routines can continue as normal.

Reason 2: Test 1 is preferred because it is consistent and reliable across 
conditions. The fan test depends on external variables that the TerraBot cannot 
fully control, such as the position of the fan, the amount of heat coming from 
sunlight, etc., which introduces noises that can cause false positives or false 
negatives. 



• (1 pt) Provide the pro and con of the chosen test, relative to the other test

Pro: It uses existing sensor data, and there is no active actuation that could 
disrupt climate targets. It's faster and safer.

Con: It relies on the assumption that the other sensor works properly. If the 
other sensor is broken, the threshold may not be triggered even though the 
readings are incorrect.
